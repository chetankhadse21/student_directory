        <h2> About Us</h2>

        <p>
            We built this platform with a simple purpose — to make every student’s academic life easier,
            faster, and more organized. From assignments and notes to practical files, unit-wise question
            papers, and theory papers, students often spend more time searching for study materials than
            actually studying them.
        </p>

        <p><b>Our website solves this problem.</b></p>

        <p>
            We bring all essential academic resources together in one clean, easy-to-use portal. Students
            can access materials instantly, track live attendance, view subject & teacher allotment,
            and manage their academic profile — all in one place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Students should focus on learning, not searching endlessly. That’s why the platform is simple,
            reliable, and always available.

        <p>
            Our goal is to build a platform that becomes a one-stop academic hub — where resources,
